### Hi there, I'm GhaniðŸ‘‹

Hello, My name is Ghani Rizky Naufal, and I'm a Computer Science major at college. I am now enrolled in Bina Nusantara University in Jakarta Barat, Indonesia. I adore coding and developing new things, and I'm interested as a Back-End Developer, but I'm open to other options as well. I'm skilled at working with people and am a laid-back individual that is enjoyable to work with.
